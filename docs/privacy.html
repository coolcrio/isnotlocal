  <h2>Cookies and server logs</h2>
  
  <h3>Cookies</h3>
  
  <p>This website website sets cookies in order to enable or enhance some functions offered within our pages.</p>

  <p>Besides the persistent and session cookies needed for this, we also set analytics cookies in order to monitor the navigation of our users and improve the quality of their experience while visiting our website.</p>

  <p>Analytics cookies are added by our Web Analytics tool, Google Analytics, and are considered as third party cookies. They help us to prepare aggregated and anonymous statistical reports on the navigation of our visitors.</p>

  <h3>Server logs</h3>
  
  <p>This website is hosted on GitHub Pages, which may record server logs in order to be able to analyse, to monitor and to diagnosis technical infrastructures and applications. See <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank">GitHub Policy</a> for more information.</p>

  <h2>What is a cookie?</h2>
  
  <p>Most websites you visit will use cookies in order to improve your user experience. They enable websites to ‚Äúremember‚Äù you - either for the duration of your visit (using a ‚Äúsession cookie‚Äù) or for repeat visits (using a ‚Äúpersistent cookie‚Äù).</p>

  <p>Cookies can have a host of different functions. They let you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences and generally improving your experience of a website. Cookies make the interaction between you and the website faster and easier. If a website does not use cookies, it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site. For example, when you close a menu and move to another page, it will not remember that you have closed the menu on the previous page and it will display the next page with that page's menu open.</p>

  <p>Some websites will also use cookies to enable them to target their advertising or marketing messages based, for example, on your location and/or browsing habits.</p>

  <p>Cookies may be set by the website which you are visiting (‚Äúfirst party cookies‚Äù) or they may be set by other websites which run content on the page you are viewing (‚Äúthird party cookies‚Äù).</p>

  <p>A cookie is a simple text file stored on your computer or mobile device by a website‚Äôs server. That server will subsequently be able to retrieve or read the contents of that cookie. Cookies are managed by your browser. Each cookie is unique and contains some anonymous information such as a unique identifier, site name, digits and letters. It allows a website to remember your browsing preferences.</p>

  <h3>First party cookies</h3>

  <p>First party cookies are set by the website which you are visiting, and they can only be read by that site.</p>

  <h3>Third party cookies</h3>
  
  <p>Third party cookies are set and used by a different organisation from the owner of the website which you are visiting. For example, to measure its audience a website might use a third-party analytics company, which will set its own cookie to perform that service. The website you are visiting may also have embedded content, e.g. YouTube videos or Flickr slideshows. Those sites may also set their own cookies.</p>

  <h3>Session cookies</h3>
  
  <p>Session cookies are stored temporarily during a browsing session and are deleted from the user's device when the browser is closed.</p>

  <h3>Persistent cookies</h3>
  
  <p>Persistent cookies are saved on your computer for a fixed period (usually a year or longer) and are not deleted when the browser is closed. They are used where we need to who you are for more than one browsing session.</p>

  <h3>What are server logs?</h3>
  
  <p>Several log types are used to support web services. Logs can be generated by network devices like firewalls, proxies and intrusion prevention and detection systems, web and application servers and web applications for technical verification, functional and compliance auditing and security purposes.</p>
